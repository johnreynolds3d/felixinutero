# Running the website #

  1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP and extract the files  
  2. Open a terminal and cd into the source directory 
  3. Enter 'python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000' to start a server on port 8000
  4. Open your web browser of choice (tested on Chrome) and enter the URL 
     'localhost:8000'; that should get you to the home page.

Many of the pages are interactive: try the WASD keys, or move around with the cursor (or your finger on a touchscreen). Enjoy!
