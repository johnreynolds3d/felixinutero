## Installation

  1.  Clone this repository  
      ```
      # git clone git@github.com:johnreynolds3d/felixinutero.git
      ```
  2.  cd into the source directory 
      ```
      # cd felixinutero
      ```
  3.  Run the following command to start a server on port 8000
      ```
      # python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000 
      ```
  4.  Open your web browser of choice (tested on Chrome) and enter the URL 
      'localhost:8000'; that should get you to the home page

Many of the pages are interactive; try the WASD keys, or move around with the cursor (or your finger on a touchscreen). Enjoy!
