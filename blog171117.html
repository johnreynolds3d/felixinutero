            <h1>What Now?
                <br>Changing Goals and Moving Toward the Future
            </h1>
            <h3>17 NOVEMBER 2017</h3>
            <p>
                In 2016, as my time at the University of Western Australia drew to a close, I found my interest shifting from Artificial
                Intelligence toward Virtual Reality. A fascination with the concept of the
                <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22930661-800-vision-of-singularity-questions-ai-intellect/">Technological Singularity</a> had been a major factor in my motivation to study Computer Science, but after
                building some simple VR apps in
                <a href="https://unity3d.com/">Unity</a>, I was hooked!
            </p>
            <p>After reading (OK,
                <i>listening to</i> on Audible) the obligatory VR primers &mdash; Neal Stephenson's
                <a href="https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Snow-Crash-Audiobook/B00FGJSMKK">Snow Crash</a>, and Ernest Cline's
                <a href="https://www.audible.com.au/pd/Sci-Fi-Fantasy/Ready-Player-One-Audiobook/B00FEZBS84">Ready Player One</a> &mdash; and while looking for inspiration in the works of prominent artists and designers,
                I stumbled across
                <a href="http://www.raycaesar.com/">Ray Caesar</a>.
            </p>
            <p>I fell immediately in love with his aesthetic, but I was staggered to learn that his images were not, as I had
                assumed, two-dimensional digital paintings, but renderings of 3D models set in painstakingly textured environments;
                each character rigged with a poseable 'skeleton' and lit as if on the set of a motion picture.</p>
            <p>In an interview, the artist fondly recalled returning to one of these 'scenes' after several years and discovering
                a letter he had penned to his wife, left in a digital chest of drawers and long since forgotten.
            </p>
            <p>I eagerly immersed myself in learning the fundamentals of this seemingly boundless creative medium with Autodesk's
                <a href="https://www.autodesk.com.au/products/maya/overview">Maya</a> (Mr. Caesar's tool of choice), then The Foundry's
                <a href="https://www.foundry.com/products/modo">Modo</a>, finally settling on the free and open-source
                <a href="https://www.blender.org/">Blender</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Then I found out about
                <a href="https://webvr.info/">WebVR</a>. I hadn't been all that taken with Web Development during the brief overview that my degree's schedule
                afforded, but the idea that these virtual worlds could be delivered on a ubiquitous platform like the web
                sealed the deal for me.
            </p>
            <p>The goal of this website is to act as my portfolio as I learn how to build something resembling at least one
                small corner of the
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse">Metaverse</a>.
